# Dotfiles
This is my first personal setup, you can use the configs and modify them freely. Terminal and bar color scheme change based on wallpaper colors using [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

### Notes
- [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) is now archived on Github and no longer maintained
- To change Rofi theme check this [repo](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection) and follow the documentation
- To change windows appearance (including file manager), install `lxappearance` for GTK and choose a [theme](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?K=gtk-theme)
- Make sure you have `~/Pictures/wallpapers` directory where your wallpapers are stored, or change the path in `qtile/wallpaper_change.sh` script accordingly
- The preset used for Starship is [Bracketed Segments](https://starship.rs/presets/bracketed-segments)
- Switch to greeter keybinding is commented in case anyone's using a different greeter
- You may consider modifying the `config.py` if you use a different browser, screenshot tool, launcher, etc..
